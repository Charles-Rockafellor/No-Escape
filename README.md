# Foolproof images, .mp3s, etc.

Used in AO3 work "Inside, Outside, Upside-dowm", at https://archiveofourown.org/works/64089790/chapters/164435695; good for keeping the typing present with creator's style turned off, though CSS is probably a better choice for most situations.

See https://archiveofourown.org/users/Charles_Rockafellor/collections for all of my writing (I break things down by thematic collection to make finding similar works easier for my readers: I tend toward physics, number theory, RomComs, food, zombies, and a little dash of MilFic, but there's a fair chunk of TTRPG and other stuff in there).
